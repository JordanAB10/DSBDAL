1. PATH of the prgram
home -> hadoop-3.3.5 -> share -> hadoop -> map reduce -> word count program


2. now open the terminal
(you should be in the hadoop system)


All the below steps on the terminal

a) jps (java process to ensure the cluster is start or not)

b) start-dfs.sh  (datanode, namenode, secondary namenode)

c) start-yarn.sh  (resource manager, node manager) (used for prepocessing)

d) jps   (check all 5 are working)

e) gedit (create a text file in the HOME DIRECTORY) (COPY THAT IN HADOOP)

f) hdfs dfs -mkdir /batchk21    (now we have to create directory) (move dfs file to hdfs)

h) hdfs dfs -ls /   (shows whether the directory is created or not)

i) hdfs dfs -ls /batchk21

j) hdfs dfs -put /home/hadoop/abhi.txt /batchk21

i) yarn jar /home/hadoop/hadoop-3.3.5/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-example-3.3.5.jar wordcount /batchk21 /outputbatchk21

k) hdfs dfs -cat /outputbatchk21/part-r-00000


stoping the process

l) stop-yarn.sh

m) stop-dfs.sh

n) jps










HADOOP THEORY

   Q) Which configuration files are required for setting the hadoop environment
Ans:  (mapred-site.xml, core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml )


  Q) What are the steps involved in setting up a Hadoop cluster ?
Ans: 

Step 1: Click here to download the Java 8 Package. Save this file in your home directory.
Step 2: Extract the Java Tar File.
Step 3: Download the Hadoop 2.7.3 Package.
Step 4: Extract the Hadoop tar File.
Step 5: Add the Hadoop and Java paths in the bash file (.bashrc).
Step 6: Edit the Hadoop Configuration files.
Step 7: Open core-site.xml and edit the property mentioned below inside configuration tag
Step 8: Edit hdfs-site.xml and edit the property mentioned below inside configuration tag
Step 9: Edit the mapred-site.xml file and edit the property mentioned below inside configuration tag
Step 10: Edit yarn-site.xml and edit the property mentioned below inside configuration tag
Step 11: Edit hadoop-env.sh and add the Java Path
Step 12: Go to Hadoop home directory and format the NameNode.
Step 13: Once the NameNode is formatted, go to hadoop-2.7.3/sbin directory and start all the daemons.
Step 14: To check that all the Hadoop services are up and running, run the below command.
